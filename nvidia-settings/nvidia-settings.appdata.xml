    <p>
      The NVIDIA Accelerated Linux Graphics Driver brings accelerated 2D
      functionality and high-performance OpenGL support to Linux with the
      use of NVIDIA graphics processing units.
    </p>
    <p>
      These drivers provide optimized hardware acceleration for OpenGL and X
      applications and support nearly all recent NVIDIA GPU products.
      The NVIDIA graphics driver uses a Unified Driver Architecture: the single
      graphics driver supports all modern NVIDIA GPUs.
    </p>
    <p>
      The nvidia-settings utility is a tool for configuring the NVIDIA graphics
      driver. It operates by communicating with the NVIDIA X driver, querying
      and updating state as appropriate. This communication is done via the
      NV-CONTROL, GLX, XVideo, and RandR X extensions.
    </p>
    <p>
      Values such as brightness and gamma, XVideo attributes, temperature, and
      OpenGL settings can be queried and configured via nvidia-settings.
    </p>
    <p>
      You need the Nvidia proprietary driver. This is not a standalone application.
